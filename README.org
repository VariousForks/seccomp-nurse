seccomp-nurse

*This project is now archived. It was a fun project but it does not compile/run anymore and there are far better mechanisms that have been implemented now: firejail, crosvm, gvisor, etc.*

* About

  =seccomp-nurse= is a sandboxing framework based on =SECCOMP=.

* How to use it?

:  $ git clone git://github.com/nbareil/seccomp-nurse.git
:  $ cd seccomp-nurse/
:  $ make
:  $ ./sandbox -- /usr/bin/pdftotext ~/resume.pdf /tmp/resume.txt

  Easy, isn't it?

* Current limitations

  - =dlopen()= not supported *yet*

  - =clone()= (so =fork()= and threads) will *never* be supported

  - =socket()=: *work in progress*!

  - =exec*()= will *never* be supported

  At the moment, there is no security check implemented. The sandbox
  is wide open! It will be the next step.
